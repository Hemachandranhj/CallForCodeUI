## Short description

### What's the problem?

During pandemic, there are many elderly/vulnerable people who need help. There are many volunteers who are ready to help but they dont whom to help

### How can technology help?

Allow elderly/vulnerable to request for help which can be serviced by Volunteers.

### The idea

Providing a web portal for Volunteers to find people who need help and for elderly people who has less exposure to digital technology requesting for help using text messages.

## Demo video

[![Watch the video](https://github.com/Hemachandranhj/CallForCodeUI/blob/master/assets/Helpingpeople.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Z-7oJPo3yyI)

## The architecture

![Video transcription/translation app](https://github.com/Hemachandranhj/CallForCodeUI/blob/master/assets/Architecture.PNG)

1. Elderly/Vulnerable users sends a text message for assistance to Twilio Programmable phone numbers.
2. Text message is forwarded to the NodeJS Web Service using Twilio Web hooks.
3. Web Service validates the request, Understand whether the request is essential/non essentials by invoking Watson Assistant API.
4. Request is stored in Mongo DB
5. Volunteers login to the portal, Picks a request and text message is sent to the Elderly/Vulnerable that assistance is on the way.

Both Web Portal and Web service is protected using IBM APP Id.

## Project roadmap

![Roadmap](roadmap.jpg)

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```bash
dnf install wget
wget http://www.example.com/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be, for example

```bash
export TOKEN="fffd0923aa667c617a62f5A_fake_token754a2ad06cc9903543f1e85"
export EMAIL="jane@example.com"
dnf install npm
node samplefile.js
Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
```

And repeat

```bash
curl localhost:3000
Thanks for looking at Code-and-Response!
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you were using something like `mocha` for instnance

```bash
npm install mocha --save-dev
vi test/test.js
./node_modules/mocha/bin/mocha
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why, if you chose `eslint` for example

```bash
npm install eslint --save-dev
npx eslint --init
npx eslint sample-file.js
```

## Live demo
